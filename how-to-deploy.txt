How to Deploy "UniversalSearch" App

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to deploy Estevan's "UniversalSearch" application on your machine using a Docker image saved as a .tar file. These instructions are applicable for both Mac and Windows operating systems.

Prerequisites

Docker: Ensure Docker is installed on your system. If it's not already installed, you can download and install Docker from Docker's official website. https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

Steps to Deploy the App

1. Transfer the Docker Image File
- Obtain the universalsearch.tar file from the source provided (e.g., via email, file transfer service, USB drive).
- Save the file to a known location on your machine.

2. Open Terminal or Command Prompt
- On Mac: Use Spotlight (Cmd + Space) to search for "Terminal".
- On Windows: Press Win + R, type cmd, and hit Enter.

3. Load the Docker Image
- Navigate to the directory where you saved universalsearch.tar. For example:
   - On Mac or Windows Command Prompt: cd path/to/directory
- Load the Docker image into your Docker system with the following command:

docker load -i universalsearch.tar

4. Run the Docker Container
- After loading the image, run it as a container with the following command:

docker run -p 4000:80 universalsearch

This command maps port 80 inside the container to port 4000 on your host machine.

5. Access the Application
- Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:4000. You should now be able to access the "UniversalSearch" application.

6. Stopping the Container (Optional)
- If you need to stop the running Docker container, open a new terminal or command prompt window.
- List all running containers with docker ps.
- Find the container ID of "UniversalSearch", then execute docker stop [container ID].

Troubleshooting

- Docker Not Running: Ensure Docker Desktop is running on your machine before executing Docker commands.

- Port Conflict: If port 4000 is already in use on your system, you can map the container to a different port by changing 4000 to another port number in the docker run command.

Enjoy the application!
